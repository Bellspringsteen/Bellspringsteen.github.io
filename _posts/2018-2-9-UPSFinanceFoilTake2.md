I believe from experience that UPS is a extraordinary blocker of bicycle lanes around NYC. Hence, my lawsuits against the company. Here as some other data points. 

The City of New York releases parking violations and any information is has on vehicles it tickets for blocking a bike lane. Unfortunately, they don't list the companies that owned the vehicles. [I sent a FOIL request to NYC for them to cross reference the license plate numbers to company ownership but they stated the cost would be over two thousand dollars.](http://blog.labsbell.com/blog/UPSFinanceFoil)
 

However, maybe we can use one extra piece of data to determine the information without having to pay. UPS trucks are brown. They are all brown. They are also distinctively brown. They are also uniquely brown. Very few other commercial vehicles in NYC would be classified as brown. What can brown do for you? 

By going to the NYC Data for [2014 tickets](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2014-August-/jt7v-77mi/data) we can query for different ticket types. 

Violation Type 9 are tickets for blocking the bike lane. 

11,041 tickets given to BROWN commercial vehicles for blocking the bike laneIn 2014, there were 11041 tickets given in NYC to BROWN commercial vehicles for blocking the bike lane. 
40,547 tickets given to commercial vehicles of any COLOR for blocking the bike lane. 
2,022,409 tickets given to commercial vehicles of any COLOR for any violations. 
271,154 tickets given to BROWN commercial vehicles for any violations. 

[Data is here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus/data#change)

BROWN Commercial vehicles, aka UPS, represent 13% of all traffic violations. 
But UPS BROWN Commercial vehicles represent 27% of all bicycle lane parking violations. 
UPS is an extraordinary blockers of bike lanes in NYC. UPS blocks bike lanes at a rate that is at least double any other company. 

And before you complain, “not all commercial brown vehicles are UPS trucks.” Yes, yes they are mostly. Show me a picture of another commercial vehicle parked in NYC that is brown with its license plate and then show me where it shows up in the database as BROWN. They are pretty much all UPS Trucks.
