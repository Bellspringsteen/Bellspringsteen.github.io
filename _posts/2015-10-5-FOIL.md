#Where do NYPD Officers Work vs Live
##Is community policing more effective if the police actually live in that community

Supposedly there is a NYPD prohibition on "against officers residing within the same precinct to which they are assigned in order to avoid potential conflicts if called upon to take enforcement action against neighbors or others they may know personally." That sounds interesting.

##Is this how you file a FOIL request?

Re: Freedom of Information Act Request

Dear Records Access Officer:
This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.
I request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to me:

* A document containing a list of all the current billing zip codes for all NYPD employees as well as their current precinct or office location. Example


  Billing Zip Code --- Precinct
  10016            --- 32nd
  10025            --- 32nd

	As you can see, there is no personally identifiable or other information included or required in this request.

* If the above request is too laborious to collate, perhaps in its stead simply provide the same data but for only officers of the 32nd Precinct.

In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am an individual seeking information for personal use and not for a commercial use.

I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,

Alex Bell
