## Inspiration: Tim's Vermeer

I watched the movie [Tim's Vermeer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim%27s_Vermeer) and wanted to give it a shot. The movie presents a hypothesis, posed by a few sources, that Vermeer used mechanical and optical aids to produce his paintings. In order to "prove" this, [Tim Jenison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewTek#Tim_Jenison) recreates the painting of a vermeer. 

One of the first examples in the film is to use a [Camera Lucida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lucida) to produce a amazing black and white picture. I decided to replicate the replication. Using a simple cosmetic mirror on the end of a rod, here are the results.

<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../img/Picture1.JPG" /> <br> <b>Step 1</b></div>
<br>

<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../img/Picture2.JPG" /> <br> <b>Step 2</b></div>
<br>

<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../img/Picture3.JPG" /> <br> <b>Step 3</b></div>
<br>

<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../img/Picture4.JPG" /> <br> <b>Step 4</b></div>
<br>

<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../img/Picture5.JPG" /> <br> <b>Step 5- 12 hours Later</b></div>
<br>

As you can see. It doesnt look very good. Jenison is a much better painter than I.
