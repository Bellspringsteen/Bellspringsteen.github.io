Where should the rear pivot on the cycle be? From v0.5B when I stuck a office chair caster wheel on the cycle the pivot was very close to the rear wheel. But in later version to simplify the design I moved the pivot towards the front.

The results? Its more maneuverable. You can perform tight tight turns. Its more fun!! But its also a little more challenging at low speeds. I think for the first version to release, I will go with the pivot towards the front but possibly with the possibility of the back pivot.
