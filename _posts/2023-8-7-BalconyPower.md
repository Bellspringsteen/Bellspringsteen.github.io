Germany has passed some lovely new regulation, google "Germany Balcony Power"

\
In effect, German standards group https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDE_e.V. and the government have drastically reduced the regulatory requirements for installing solar power. For less than 600W, you can basically just plug your micro inverter right into an outlet and strap the panels on the roof.
\ 
Some facts that might make this make sense:
* Solar panel prices just keep falling, incredible
* Increasinly the major prohibitive cost to installation is the regulatory and the man power
* But actual installation is super simple
* Panel mounted horizontal on a facade is not amazing for power, BUT, its so cheap, maybe it makes sense in the long run.

If NYC had this, could be interesting.
