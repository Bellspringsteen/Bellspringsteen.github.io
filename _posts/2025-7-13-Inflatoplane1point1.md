## Inflatoplane 1.1

TLDR: Got better drop stitch material, now it really flies well!

Part 1, https://blog.labsbell.com/blog/Inflatodrone <br><br>

For 1.1, clearly I needed better drop stitch material. Will and Jay from (https://www.thirddimensiontextilesolutions.com/ and textechindustries.com ) supplied me with a 1 inch thick, TPU coated, light weight fabric. (https://www.dropstitch.org/) <br><br>

As a relative RC Airplane n00b, I went for a simple shape thats probably not optimal. Better would be more sweep, more thought to CG location. <br><br>

## Engine/Electronics Box
<br><br>
To attach the electronics I 3d printed out of TPU a box with some holding straps that I glued to the wing. This allows me to easily tie the electronics box on and take it off to swap battery. 
<br><br>
Motor went with A2212 motor with 8086 propeller all from alliexpress, cheapest prices. Speedybee mini FC. 
<br><br>

## How does it fly? 
<br><br>
Well it flies really well compared to version 1 :). Remember that I am a R/C n00b. It it easy to launch, pretty easy to steer around. Propellers usually break off when i land/ crash. When I started flying it, i had elevons sized about 10% of wing and no tails. It would just spin out. 
<br>

* Angled the motor 3 degrees to the right
*  Made elevons big 25% of wing size
* Added tail

<br>
Next Steps <br>

* Trying elevons built into drop stitch. Maybe bending wing to make more airfoil shape. 
* Work with some manufacturers to see how they can make it
* Two motors with differential thrust instead of tail?
* Much much bigger plane
