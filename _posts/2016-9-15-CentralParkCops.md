Central Park is closed to vehicles (except the very southern part)

Police officers have a habit of ignoring this and just driving their private vehicles through the park.

## NYPD Response

I received the below a few weeks after going into the Central Park Precinct. 

HERRERA, EDWARD <EDWARD.HERRERA@nypd.org>            May 19

This E-mail is in regards to a complaint you had made against PO Valdez driving his private vehicle in Central Park. I Sgt. Herrera spoke with the officer and instructed him  regards to this complaint. The officer is willing to no longer drive his private in Central Private. If you wish to add anything you can e-mail me at Edward.Herrera@NYPD.org


They still drive their vehicles through the park. Officer Herrera doesn't respond.
