## Very Short Story

We are filing a Class Action lawsuit against UPS for parking in the bicycle lane. Visit UPSHatesCyclists.com to join. Tell your NYC bicycle friends.

## Short Story

UPS parks in bicycle lanes in NYC more than any other single entity in the city. 

The small dollar amount of tickets they receive do no not outweigh the convenience to their operations of free parking. 

Parking in the bike lane forces the 15mph cyclist to merge abruptly into 45mph traffic coming from behind. 

I have called. I have written. I have asked. [I have filed a small claims lawsuit](http://blog.labsbell.com/blog/VsUPS). I have filed a [New York State Supreme court lawsuit.]()

We are getting close, we need NYC cyclists to go to [UPSHatesCyclists.com](UPSHatesCyclists.com) and join the lawsuit.
