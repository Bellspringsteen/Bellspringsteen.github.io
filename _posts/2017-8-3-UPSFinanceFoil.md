In the hunt to get even more data showing the degree to which UPS is an extraordinary blocker of bike lanes in NYC, I filed the below FOIL request to the NYC Finance Department. 

* The fleet application by the United Parcel Service or any of its subsidiaries to enroll in the NYC Delivery Solutions program
* The number of tickets issued to the United Parcel Service or any of its subsidiaries in 2015 in the NYC Delivery Solutions program.
* The dollar amount of tickets issued as well the final amount paid by the United Parcel Service or any of its subsidiaries in the NYC Delivery Solutions program.
* The number of tickets given to the United Parcel Service or any of its subsidiaries for violations of NYS Traffic Section 4-08(e)(9) parking in a bicycle lane in 2015 in the NYC Delivery Solutions program.
* The dollar amount paid by the United Parcel Service or any of its subsidiaries for for violations of NYS Traffic Section 4-08(e)(9) parking in a bicycle lane in 2015 in the NYC Delivery Solutions program.
* Any documents relating to whether or not violations of NYS Traffic Section 4-08(e)(9) parking in a bicycle lane are accepted for reduced fines as part of the NYC Delivery Solutions Program.


After the customary rejection and appeal, the finance department provided [this response](https://github.com/Bellspringsteen/other.nyc/blob/master/NYCGOV/Finance/UPSFOILFinanceResponse.pdf)


1. They are willing to provide data on UPS and non-UPS blocking of the bike lanes. However, they have decided it will cost 2k$. The searches can be accomplished by writing two SQL queries and would take any reasonably competent person 1 hour to retrieve the data.

2. The response also indicated that while the bike lane tickets are supposed to be among a class, along with parking in front of a hydrant, that are non-amenable that they do have their dollar amount reduced for UPS. 


We need the 2,002$ required to get the records from the finance department.
