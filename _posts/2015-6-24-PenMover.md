## A Cool 2 Axis Pen Mover Device

A simple project, https://github.com/Bellspringsteen/penmover that uses 2 really cheap (<2$ at scale) stepper motors.

I originally thought of using this form of setup to do 3D printing. I.e. instead of the usual frame with a extruder head riding between axis, this would use a extruder on the end of a long rod. Using three stepper motors you could control the position of the extruder head without the large frame.

The inexpensive motors to do not have the required accuracy nor is there enough mechanical assistance in the design to increase the torque of the motor.
