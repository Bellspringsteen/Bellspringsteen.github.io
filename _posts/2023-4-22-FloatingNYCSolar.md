Some back of the napkin math 

* Solar panels keep getting cheaper and will probably continue
* Current NYC Summer peak at hottest time is 11000 Megawatts. 
* Floating solar on the hudson river, resevoirs, long island sound could be an interesting place to put a lot of solar panels

### How much power does NYC use?

NYSIO Zone J - which is NYC, I think. Durring summer we peak on the worst days at 11000 Megawatts. https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2226333/2022-Gold-Book-Final-Public.pdf
Current power comes from https://www.nyiso.com/real-time-dashboard

To replace all this with solar is very complicated. What about night? What about cloudy days? What about winter? Etc etc. But lets just simplify.

### How many panels?

Ignoring all details such as panel age, cleanliness, angle, MPPT efficiency, etc. Ignoring all of that.

11000 Megawatts/350 Watts = 32,000,000 panels

Current bulk costs are $0.10/Watt so 1.1 Billion Dollars ( Just panels, ignoring inverters, support, hookup, etc)

Assuming 12 watts per square foot, so lets say 1 billion square feet, thats 35 square miles. 

### Can we float these solar panels?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_solar

Hudson River - Half of the hudson river along the side of Manhattan would be 5 square miles. 

Jamaica Bay - 24 square miles

Resevoirs - https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwater/html/drinking/reservoir.shtml NYC resevoirs which are closed to motorized boats are about 25 square miles in surface area.

Long Island Sound- Easily fit a 35 square mile section
