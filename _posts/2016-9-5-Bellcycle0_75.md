What would a tandem cycle with this design look like? I decided to return to the brazing torch and try it out. In the process I wanted to check some assumptions.

*Is the rear pivot/second degree of freedom really that important?
*What if the cycle is heavier with weight on the back?

First I tested with no pivot between the two wheels and no spring. It was as before, rideable but just. Not fun.

Then I cut the bars and added a pivot in. Rideable and fun.

I did find a picture of what looks like a similarish design for a tandem penny farthing. However, as far as I can see there is no rear pivot. So riding this was probably a little challenging.
